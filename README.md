# Data-Modelling-and-Visualization-with-Power-BI
This project leverages Power BI to perform in-depth HR analytics, focusing on employee attrition and performance trends. The goal is to provide actionable insights that support data-driven decision making, optimize HR functions, and strengthen overall HR strategies within an organization.

## Project Background

Company A has been established for over 40 years and employs 1,470 staff. Historically, the company maintained a stable annual attrition rate of around 15%, indicating a healthy workforce.

In 2018, the attrition rate spiked to 47.58%, creating significant risks to organizational stability. Management tasked the HR Department with conducting analytics to identify causes, reduce turnover, and develop data-driven strategies to enhance workforce management, talent acquisition, employee engagement, and organizational performance.
