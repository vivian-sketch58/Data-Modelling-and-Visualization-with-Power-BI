# Data-Modelling-and-Visualization-with-Power-BI
Interactive dashboards and HR analytics for employee attrition, performance tracking, and workforce insights.

## Background

Company A has been established for over 40 years and employs 1,470 staff. Historically, the company maintained a stable annual attrition rate of around 15%, indicating a healthy workforce.
